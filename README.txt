CONCERNING THE DATABASE.
-The attached .sql must be run from MySQL workbench before running the project.
-We also offer a scrip that fills a database with test information to run the project.

BEFORE EXECUTING THE PROJECT:
-The data of the two config.json files must be modified.
-The server must always be up and running for the client to work.
